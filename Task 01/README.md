# Caesar Cipher Implementation

This Python script implements a basic Caesar cipher, which is a simple encryption technique where each letter in the plaintext is shifted by a fixed number of positions down the alphabet. 

This project demonstrates how to encrypt and decrypt messages using the Caesar cipher algorithm.



## Features

- Encrypts a message by shifting letters based on user-defined shift value.
- Decrypts the encrypted message using the inverse of the shift value.
- Handles both uppercase and lowercase letters, preserving their case.
- Non-alphabetic characters remain unchanged.



## Requirements

- Python 3.x



## Usage

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run the script using Python:
   - python caesar_cipher.py
4. Follow the prompts to enter a message and a shift value.
